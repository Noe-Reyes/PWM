## How it works

My project involves Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), allowing the duty cycle to be adjusted between 10% and 80% using 3 switches with 7 different combinations. Each combination increments the duty cycle by 10%. For example, '000' represents a 10% duty cycle, and '111' represents an 80% duty cycle. The PWM was designed for a frequency of 1KHz.

## How to test

First, the reset should be activated and desactivated, and second, you can choose the combination of switches to observe the change in LED intensity.

## External hardware
The external hardware includes one LED, a 1k ohm resistor, and three 2-position switches.
